-	in lines with macroname for expansion, check before the line: (expand_macros_handle_command_state)
		strstr lookup of each declared macroname against words in line
		if exists, assuming lines started with non blank, check for a blank before that index - if exists, return an error
-	dive deeper into errors possible when reading words for commands
-	extern declaration shouldn't save a word with an address, only the existence of it
	usage should cause a label with an address to be added (later on in code)
-	are_type for EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL!!
