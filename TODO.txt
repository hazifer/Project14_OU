-	in lines with macroname for expansion, check before the line: (expand_macros_handle_command_state)
		strstr lookup of each declared macroname against words in line
		if exists, assuming lines started with non blank, check for a blank before that index - if exists, return an error
-	dive deeper into errors possible when reading words for commands
	characters after arguments, seperated with comma, commas, multiple words more than needed etc
-	cmp r3, -6 prints wrong error (about a non declared label)
-	prioriotize outputting a comma at end of line if exists
-	sign extension of field 4 in negative data types is wrong - should only extend the msb of field 4
