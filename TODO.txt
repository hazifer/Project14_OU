-	in lines with macroname for expansion, check before the line: (expand_macros_handle_command_state)
		strstr lookup of each declared macroname against words in line
		if exists, assuming lines started with non blank, check for a blank before that index - if exists, return an error
-	is label data type needed?
-	labels should conform to digit and alphabetic characters only
-	.extern and .entry should be ignored as commands by instruction counter
-	after_macro_handle_label should return something instead of just saving into error_return
